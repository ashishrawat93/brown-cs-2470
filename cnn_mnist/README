BUGS:
        As is the case with all neural networks, very rarely does the model give
        an accuracy of less than 96 percent.

IMPLEMENTATION:
        MODEL USES PADDING TO ENSURE CONV LAYERS PRESERVE THE DIMENSIONS. Padding="SAME".

        1. Conv Layer 1 , Kernel = 4 x 4 x 1, Stride = (1,1),  
                Number of Filters: 32, activations squashed using a RELU function.
        
        2. MaxPool layer, Kernel = 2 x 2 , Stride = (1,1),  

        3. Conv Layer 2, Kernel = 4 x 4 x 32, Stride = (2,2),
                Number of Filters: 64, activations squashed using a RELU function.

        4. MaxPool layer, Kernel = 2 x 2, Stride = (2,2),

        5. Fully Connected Layer, number of input neurons = 3136, output neurons = 500, which is the flattened input 
                from MaxPool layer.
        6. Logits passed through RELU activation function.

        7. Fully Connected Layer, input neurons = 500 to output neurons = 10 ,

        8. Logits passed through a softmax function.

ACCURACY:
        Test Accuracy : 97%-98%
