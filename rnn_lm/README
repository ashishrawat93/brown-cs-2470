Perplexity ~ 200

Embedding size was chosen to be 65 as the vocabulary size was not too large.

RNN Size was chosen to be 300, as this allows us to compensate for the small embedding size that we chose above.

Dropout Regularization was used with a keep_prob of 0.7, as the RNN Size is somewhat large, this was required to prevent overfitting.
