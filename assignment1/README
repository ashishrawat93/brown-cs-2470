ACCURACY:
The Model trains on 10,000 random images from the 60,000 training images. 
The Model achieves an test accuracy between 0.78 and 0.85, which amounts to an average test accuracy of 0.804 averages across 10 runs.

BUGS:
There are no appearent bugs in the Model.

TESTING:
Instantiate a model object by calling the Model() class initializer and passing in two arguments, namely training data and training labels as follows
        model = Model(train_images, train_labels)

where train_images is a 2D numpy array, where each row represents image pixel values
where train_labels is a numpy vector, denoting the correct label of ith train_images

To train the model, call the model's run() method, which takes no argument. Run executes just one step of SGD on a randomly sampled training sample 
Call run 10,000 times to ensure the model is trained sufficiently.

To test the accuracy of the model call the accuracy_function() method, which takes in two arguemnts, namely test data and test labels.

DATA:
The model does not normalize data, so any data passed to the model should already be normalized.
