Model Parameters:
    Learning rate of 0.5 was ideal for the network as the network needed to quickly reach the optimal weight,
    and 0.5 did not lead to overfitting.

    Standard deviation of 0.1 as input to tf.random_normal, the model performed better with higher values of
    initialized weights and biases, therefore these values were not multiplied by a small constant to make them
    smaller.

    Batch Size of 100 samples was used.

    A total of 2000 batches were used, and batches were sampled at random from the entire training data.
